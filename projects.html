                                My time as a research intern at the USGS, we worked on a solution to develop a
                                cloud-based 3D basemap of populated areas and surrounding wildland terrain to 
                                enhance the decision-making process in wildfire management. The model was designed to use 
                                GIS, XR, AI, and other advanced digital technologies to create a more intuitive and visual interface for fire professionals and the public. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My particular role within the research program was to help develop an experimental convolutional neural network to 
                                help identify the likelihood of fire by a series a crowd-sourced images of flora in the local area. This internship allowed
                                me to learn quite a bit about machine learning and CNNs in general. As well I learned the dynamics of the Agile framework
                                and how it is important to stay flexible within a project that switches direction continously.

                                My project with JavaFX chess is a fully functioning chess game programmed in Java using JavaFX as the graphical utility. 
                                The main programming concepts used are inheritance and abstract classes. Every piece is a subclass of the abstract class 
                                Piece. This enables code reuse to a great capacity. The board is created using a GridPane with Square objects inhabiting 
                                the cells of the grid. Within the Square object is the designated piece and the location of the square.

                                I am most proud of this project as it was a bit of a struggle at times especially when trying to debug a 
                                fairly large project such as this one. It also affirms my affection for the game of chess. I play chess 
                                fairly regularly but don't expect too much. I'm not that good :(

                                In the midst of my spring semester in my freshman year, I was invited and applied to ASU's SolarSPELL initiative sponsored by Google.
                                Here I got to collaborate with some inspiring individuals in the workshop to problem solve an ongoing issue that SolarSPELL had been experiencing.
                                The issue was related to their need for machine learning to streamline how their users interacted with data they had been collecting.
                                
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This workshop lasted a few weeks and we ended it with a presentation of our proposed solution to a Google ML Researcher. Our solution was to use generative AI such as Bard
                                or a word2vec ML model to generate metadata to improve the search feature in their library of educational resources.

                                CHOPS was a cohort ran by AZNext which is a federally funded program ran by ASU to help educate individuals on an array
                                of topics from IT, Cybersecurity, Business, and Robotics. I was in their cybersecurity session this spring where we got to meet and 
                                network with a handful of industry professionals firsthand. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We trained real-life skills in cybersecurity during the eight weeks between seeing command-line attacks in real time, using applications such
                                as Splunk and QRadar to test and monitor vulnerabilities, learning the business perspective, and interview prep with ASU's CommLab. Learning how attacks happen and the consequences 
                                that they carry contextualizes how important the industry is as a whole to every business.

                                    During my high school years, I was the programmer for my robotics high school team. I programmed an autonomous and tele-operable
                                    robot in Java to compete for the 2022 FIRST Robotics Competition. This robot used graduate level robotics control theory such as PID and route pathing
                                    to enhance control and effciency of the robot during competition.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This is the patient zero of my programming journey. Robotics was such as impactful experience on my life and career that I majored in Computer Science
                                    and found a passion for programming. Still, even in college, this project remains one of the greatest projects I have ever worked on.
                                    That's me on the far left with the flag by the way :)
